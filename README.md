# How to Install

First, you need to [install the latest version of Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/).

**Currently, Quanto Flx is still in the EARLY BETA version, so there is no visual installation package for the time being. Its stability cannot be guaranteed, and it cannot replace Quanto Original temporarily.**

However, you can still [download Quanto Flx here](https://github.com/SteveHsuDrawing/quantoflx/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and install it manually (Copy/unzip `@Resources` and `Package` folder to `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\QuantoFlx`. You will need to create `QuantoFlx` folder in `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins`).

The Plugins that need to be installed are listed in the "Special Thanks" list below. You can view the Plugins you have installed in `%APPDATA%\Rainmeter\Plugins`.

If you encounter problems during the experience or have better suggestions, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/SteveHsuDrawing/quantoflx/issues) here.
